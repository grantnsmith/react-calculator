# React Calculator

## Description
I built a simple calculator using React without following any guides, just to see how far I could get. It's built with only functional components and React hooks combined with "vanilla" CSS. 

## Lessons
* Re-learning the basics of CSS: After using CSS frameworks for all my recent projects, figuring out how to do some simple formatting and mobile responsiveness proved difficult using just basic CSS. 
* The usefulness of useEffect: For an app that required calculation to be done "in the background", the useEffect hook was very useful. Combining useEffect with a "helper" function to calculate the equations was the key that got it working.
* More to come...

## Bugs and Additions
* After an equation is done, you have to click "AC" to then be able to start a new equation (otherwise it just adds the numbers to current total)
* If you keep pressing equals after an equation is calculated, it keeps doing the same calcuation over and over
* Add additional operators (like %) and enable positive/negative button.
