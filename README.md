# React Calculator

## Description
I built a simple calculator using React without following any guides, just to see how far I could get. It's built with only functional components and React hooks combined with "vanilla" CSS. 

## Lessons
* Re-learning the basics of CSS: After using CSS frameworks for all my recent projects, figuring out how to do some simple formatting and mobile responsiveness proved difficult using just basic CSS. 
* The usefulness of useEffect: For an app that required calculation to be done "in the background", the useEffect hook was very useful. Combining useEffect with a "helper" function to calculate the equations was the key that got it working.
* More to come...

## Bugs and Additions
* Build functionality to enable equations on the total of previous equation 
* Add additional operators (like %) and enable positive/negative button.
